# Interview Topics: Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures, which are frequently asked in technical interviews.

## Stack
A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure that can be implemented in several ways.
- Implement stack using an array.
- Implement stack using a queue.
- Implement stack using a linked list.

## Queue
A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
- Implement queue using an array.
- Implement queue using a stack.

## Linked List
A linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Implement linked list (singly, doubly, or circularly).
